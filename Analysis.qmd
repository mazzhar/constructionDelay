# Cronbach Analysis

| No. | Raw Alpha | Std. Alpha | G6(SMC) | Avg. r | S/N |  ASE | Mean |   SD | Median r |
|----:|----------:|-----------:|--------:|-------:|----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|---------:|
|   1 |      0.89 |       0.89 |    0.96 |    0.2 | 7.8 | 0.02 | 3.68 | 0.51 |     0.19 |

: Table 1: Cronbach's Alpha Result

## Interpretation of Cronbach's Alpha Result Overview:

Cronbach's Alpha analysis was performed to assess the internal consistency and reliability of the survey instrument. The following key indices were derived:

1.  Raw Alpha: 0.89
2.  Standardized Alpha: 0.89
3.  Guttman's Lambda 6 (G6/Smc): 0.96
4.  Average Inter-Item Correlation (Avg. r): 0.2
5.  Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N): 7.8
6.  Average Standard Error (ASE): 0.02
7.  Mean: 3.68
8.  Standard Deviation (SD): 0.51
9.  Median Inter-Item Correlation (Median r): 0.19

## Key Findings:

### Reliability:

The obtained Cronbach's Alpha of 0.89 indicates high internal consistency, suggesting that the survey items are measuring a common underlying construct reliably.

### Item Correlation:

The average inter-item correlation (Avg. r) of 0.2 signifies a moderate positive correlation between survey items, supporting the coherence of the instrument.

### Signal-to-Noise Ratio:

The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N) of 7.8 suggests a strong signal relative to noise, reinforcing the reliability of the survey instrument.

### Scale Properties:

The mean score of 3.68 reflects a balanced response pattern, while the standard deviation (SD) of 0.51 indicates moderate variability in responses.

### Homogeneity:

Guttman's Lambda 6 (G6/Smc) value of 0.96 indicates high homogeneity among survey items, reinforcing the internal consistency of the scale.

### Implications:

The high Cronbach's Alpha and other indices affirm the reliability and internal consistency of the survey instrument, supporting its validity for measuring the intended construct.

## Conclusion:

The robust reliability metrics obtained from the Cronbach's Alpha analysis validate the survey instrument's ability to consistently measure the targeted construct. Researchers can confidently utilize the instrument in future studies to gather reliable and internally consistent data.

# Factor Analysis

## Factor Analysis Loadings

Factor analysis loadings are presented in Table 2. It represents the strength and direction of the relationship between observed variables (questions or items) and the underlying latent factors extracted through factor analysis. These loadings indicate how much each variable contributes to or is associated with each factor.

In the context of our table, each cell under the columns for Factor 1 (Project Planning and Management Decisions), Factor 2 (Subcontractor Issues and Safety Measures), and Factor 3 (Delays and Approvals in Project Execution) contains a loading value for the corresponding variable (question).

The three factors from factor analysis are like special groups of questions that go together. They show how questions are connected. Factor analysis helps us find and understand these groups.

**1. Positive Loadings:** A positive loading indicates a positive correlation between the variable and the factor. If the factor score increases, the variable's score is also expected to increase.

**2. Negative Loadings:** A negative loading indicates a negative correlation between the variable and the factor. If the factor score increases, the variable's score is expected to decrease.

**3. Magnitude of Loadings:** The magnitude (absolute value) of the loading indicates the strength of the relationship. Larger absolute values represent stronger relationships, and values closer to 0 indicate weaker relationships.

**4. Loading Patterns:** Variables with high loadings on a particular factor are considered to be more strongly associated with that factor. In your case, for example, if a variable has a high loading on Factor 1, it means that the variation in that variable is well explained by Factor 1.

## Interpretation of Factor Analysis Results

Table 2 shows how each variable is related to three factors. The numbers in the table are called factor loadings. They show how strongly each variable is associated with each factor. A high number (more than 0.5) means that the variable is very related to the factor. A low number (less than 0.3) means that the variable is not very related to the factor. The following table summarizes the high loadings (\>0.3) for each factor.

Table 3: Summary of Factor Analysis Loadings

The question Q21 has a low factor loading on all three factors, which means that it is not strongly related to any of them. The question is about the low profit margin, which might be influenced by other factors not included in the analysis, such as market demand, competition, quality, etc.

### Overall Implications

Understanding these underlying factors provides valuable insights for project management interventions and strategic planning. Targeted efforts addressing the identified factors can lead to more efficient and successful project outcomes. Researchers and practitioners can leverage these findings to tailor interventions and improve project management practices.
